# New World

With the MVP implementation done, Steve is unleashed on the world!

Unfortunately, as this is an old account, I cannot start in the novice area. Instead, Steve will have to fend for himself in one of the slightly less peaceful 'Respawn' areas.

With the code as it is, Steve will be busy single-handedly upgrading the controller. Lets wish him luck, but I fear he wont last long without an upgrade!
