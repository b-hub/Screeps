# Typescript Starter

The project was created on top of the [screeps-typescript-starter](https://github.com/screepers/screeps-typescript-starter) project. The documentation can be found [here](https://screepers.gitbook.io/screeps-typescript-starter/).

The starter allows for the Screeps AI to be written in TypeScript which is then built into a single JavaScript file to be uploaded to Screeps. The 'src' folder contains all the TypeScript files for the AI and the final JavaScript file is build from a single 'main.ts' entry point. 

```
$ npm run watch-sim
```

 Using the ErrorMapper.wrapLoop function will bloat the main.js output file.
