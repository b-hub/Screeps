# Screeps AI
This is a personal implementation of a [Screeps](https://screeps.com/) AI. The aim of the project is to create an AI only using the default libraries available in Screeps and to document my progress.

## Tools used
[screeps-typescript-starter](https://github.com/screepers/screeps-typescript-starter)
for development environment. It provides a framework for testing and the ability to push changes directly to the screeps server.
